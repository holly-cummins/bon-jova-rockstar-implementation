An implementation of Rockstar as a JVM language

[Rockstar](https://codewithrockstar.com) is an example of an “esoteric language,” designed to be interesting rather than intuitive, efficient or especially functional. 
Rockstar’s interesting feature is that its programs use the lyrical conventions of eighties rock ballads. 
Rockstar has been implemented in [many languages](https://codewithrockstar.com/code), but not as a JVM language. (There are existing Java implementations, but they rely on interpretation, rather than compilation to bytecode.) 
This is clearly (clearly!) a gap that needed fixing. 

This implementation uses the [Antlr grammar for Rockstar](https://github.com/ascheja/rockstar-antlr4/tree/master) by Andreas Scheja as a starting point.
